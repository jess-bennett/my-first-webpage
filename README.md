# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

This is my first creation for the Fullstack Web Developer course that I am currently doing. 

## Project
The purpose of the project was to familiarise myself with Gitpod and Github, and learn about how they interact together. 

It also serves as a memo to myself regarding the different technologies I will be learning about and using throughout the course. 

### Technologies used:
  * HTML
  * CSS
